# Human-Activity-Recognition

## Introduction
The dataset is retrieved from https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/human-activity-recognition-with-smartphones?resource=download.

The Human Activity Recognition database was built from the recordings of 30 study participants performing activities of daily living (ADL) while carrying a waist-mounted smartphone with embedded inertial sensors. The objective is to classify activities into one of the six activities performed.

### Description of experiment
The experiments have been carried out with a group of 30 volunteers within an age bracket of 19-48 years. Each person performed six activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Using its embedded accelerometer and gyroscope, we captured 3-axial linear acceleration and 3-axial angular velocity at a constant rate of 50Hz. The experiments have been video-recorded to label the data manually. The obtained dataset has been randomly partitioned into two sets, where 70% of the volunteers was selected for generating the training data and 30% the test data.

The sensor signals (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying noise filters and then sampled in fixed-width sliding windows of 2.56 sec and 50% overlap (128 readings/window). The sensor acceleration signal, which has gravitational and body motion components, was separated using a Butterworth low-pass filter into body acceleration and gravity. The gravitational force is assumed to have only low frequency components, therefore a filter with 0.3 Hz cutoff frequency was used. From each window, a vector of features was obtained by calculating variables from the time and frequency domain.

### Attribute information
For each record in the dataset the following is provided:

Triaxial acceleration from the accelerometer (total acceleration) and the estimated body acceleration.

Triaxial Angular velocity from the gyroscope.

A 561-feature vector with time and frequency domain variables.

Its activity label.

An identifier of the subject who carried out the experiment.

## Implementation plan

This project trains a machine learning model using a custom pipeline. It supports data ingestion, preprocessing, training, evaluation, and deployment through a REST API.
